  CHARP  is  a  Web  Application  framework  for  the  development  of
  applications with modern development techniques.  At its core, CHARP
  allows you to call stored procedures inside your PostgreSQL database
  through a simple HTTP POST  request, and receive the results in JSON
  format.  This  is the heart  of a collection  of tools that  we have
  gathered for the development of  our web projects, which has allowed
  us to code  as little as possible inside the web  server, and let us
  concentrate on the processes that  fetch or alter information in our
  databases, and the user interaction code for the browser.
  
  The main philosophy  of CHARP is to be simple and  slim. The tools we
  depend on do  not have a huge complexity, they  can be configured and
  developed  on  with  any  text  editor,  with  no  compilation  stage
  necessary, and they  are all readily available in  your typical Linux
  distribution. And of course, they are all Free Software, although you
  can also develop on Windows using Cygwin and so on. MacOS X remains
  untested, but it is very probable that a MacOS X installation of
  CHARP would be successful.
